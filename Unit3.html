        <h3 id="Beginning">In the beginning there were two</h3>
        <br />
        <p id="Found">When we first met Tracks, she was a stray teenage tabby cat mother of a litter of six. She had been found by a former coworker that reached out to us and others to help adopt off the kittens. The former coworker named her Socks. My former colleague was successful in giving away all the cats except for Tracks and one of her kittens. After a bit of convincing my boyfriend at the time, we took in both. We did not have plans to adopt them. However, I knew I would be able to since when he walked in and look at Tracks he stated &ldquo;At least she is beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
        <br />
        <p id="Naming">We did not like Socks for her. The name seemed so generic and common for her. So, while laying on the floor on either side of her, my boyfriend and I mulled over some names. Then we did the odd thing and asked decided to ask her what she liked as a name. My boyfriend said that her markings looked like she got into white paint and left tracks all over. So, we asked her if she liked &ldquo;Tracks&rdquo; for a name. She remained indifferent until we called out to her as &ldquo;Tracks&rdquo; and she immediately meowed. Every time we said it, she meowed. That is how she named herself.</p>
        <br />
        <p id="Scoops">As I stated, Tracks was not the only cat, as she had a litter of kittens. We were giving her and her remaining female kitten. She was a very small black and white tabby. She was so small she fit in your palm. Since when knew she was just too young to decide her name like her mother, we decided to call her Scoops. On the day we decided to give them both a forever home with us, I came home from work to Scoops being unresponsive. Taking her to the vet, they concluded that Scoops had a digestive disease from being born in a dumpster. We could barely afford any treatments, but first was a surgery. We ended up having to make the very hard decision to either try for surgery or put her down. We decided to try for the surgery, but before they were able to do the surgery, her condition worsened. We ended up having to euthanize her. It was heartbreaking. My boyfriend did not believe any animal should be alone. So, a hunt for a second cat began.</p>

        <h3 id="Three">Then there were three</h3>
        <br />
        <p id="Searching">After the sadness of losing Scoops, we decided to go out and find a black kitten. We drove all over the city and to many shelters, finally ending up at the Animal Humane Society. We walked in and they had a room full of adorable kittens. As we walked in, I point and said, &ldquo;Look, there is a black one,&rdquo; to my boyfriend. His attention as a little further off to the side as he pointed and said, &ldquo;There&lsquo;s a white one too.&rdquo;</p>
        <br />
        <p id="Boys">We adopted both and that is how Obsidian (the black one) and Othello (the white one) joined our household.</p>

        <h3 id="Four">Along came a canine</h3>
        <br />
        <p id="Doggo">Years, after a marriage and a divorce where I got all the kittens, I was out with my roommate and current boyfriend for a Christmas dinner. As we were crossing the street after dinner, my roommate called out to me. Looking back, I found her stopping a cute little Brindle Boxer dog that was begging for the food she was holding. No one else was around. Two weeks and three microchip checks later, we decided to keep him; however, there was a comprimise that needed to be made. She already had two dogs and I told her a long time before that the next dog in the house goes to me and the next cat goes to her. I had not planned on getting a dog, but he should planned to become mine. So, Washburn became the next part of my household.</p>
