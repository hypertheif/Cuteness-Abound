    <h5>&hellip;things happened&hellip;</h5>
    <p>I was a teenage mom that was found in the dumpster with my new litter of kittens by my mommy&rsquo;s former coworker. She had taken taken all in and called me &ldquo;Socks&rdquo; but I always knew I was better than that. She took care of me and my litter for a little while and then, slowly, she found new homes for my kittens. Then all that was left was me and one of my kittens.</p>
    <p>Next thing I knew, my last kitten and I were suddenly moving in with my mommy, but I remember her telling me that we just have to convince daddy to keep me. &lsquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; I thought. I knew I was right when the first time he saw me and said I was beautiful.</p>
    <h2>The Big Sister Diva</h2>

    <h5>&hellip;new brothers&hellip;</h5>
    <p>Soon after my new parents decided to adopt me and my baby, she became very sick and died. My mommy and daddy were sad, but my daddy said that I needed a &ldquo;companion&rdquo; to play with. I thought, &lsquo;No I don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m purr-fectly fine it being just us, but they didn&rsquo;t listen to me. Next thing I knew, they brought home my enemy, Obsidian, and the &ldquo;special one,&rdquo; Othello.</p>
    <p>I know the truth those. They are actually my toys.</p>
    <p>Years later, mommy moved away from daddy, but he still comes to see me. After a while, I thought we were good, but then she bought that energetic puppy, Washburn. I am not pleased with him, but he avoids me, I will let him stay.</p>
