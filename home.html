        <p id="Welcome"><h3>Welcome to the Cuteness</h3></p>
        <p>Salutations and welcome. Here is the daily lives and interactions of my three children with paws.</p>
        <p>Tracks is the oldest and the first cat adopted into the family. She was a stray found and adopted into the family after she became a teenage mom.</p>
        <p>Obsidian is the second oldest, because he was introduced into the household three days before Othello. Obsidian, fondly nicknamed Sid-Sid, is a rescue from the animal shelter. Later we found out he as naturally going blind.</p>
        <p>Othello is the youngest of the cats, having been brought home three days after Obsidian due to being neutered. He is occasionally called Toasted Marshmallow. He was also found at the animal shelter.</p>
        <p>Washburn is the baby, and only dog, within the Cuteness. He was a stray that bumped into us and lead to his forever home.</p>
